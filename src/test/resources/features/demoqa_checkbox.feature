Feature: Verify Demoqa checkboxes

  Scenario: User Should be able to expand all checkbox options and select public and private

    Given I navigate to "https://demoqa.com/checkbox"
    When I expand all checkboxes
    And I check public and private
    Then I should see a text called "You have selected :publicprivate"
    And I quit the browser
